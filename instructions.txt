1. Create a human (Main character) agent
2. Make it able to move from side to side and jump
3. Make dollar bill collectables and keep track of how many one has collected
4. Make human theives agents
5. Make them able to move on their own
6. If Main Character comes in contact with theif, game over

Bonus Step for cool kids only: Look up what Pushing to github is after not being able to pull request the branch, have the only advice be to 
make a file WITHIN main and make a new branch when I commit changes, and pray there's no difference between this and the HW instructions :]
(It's me, I'm cool kids)
