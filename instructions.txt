1. Create a human (Main character) agent.
2. Make it able to move from side to side and jump up and down.
3. Make dollar bill collectibles and keep track of how many one has collected.
4. Make a list of weapons depending on the number of dollars.
5. Make human thieves become agents.
6. Make them able to move on their own.
7. Make weapon accessibility from approaching the enemy.
8. If Main Character comes in contact with thief, then it's game over.

Bonus Step for cool kids only: Look up what Pushing to github is after not being able to pull request the branch, have the only advice be to 
make a file WITHIN main and make a new branch when I commit changes, and pray there's no difference between this and the HW instructions :]
(It's me, I'm cool kids)
